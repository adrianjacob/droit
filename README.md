### Notes

When i was making this on Sunday I noticed James Howell was updating the figma (moving the buttons in the card) which is a better UX look however I have built it with the buttons outside as I thought you guys set it that way on purpose to make it an interersting build challenge :p

### If i had more time

So much more can be done (only so much you can do in the time I had available at the weekend given prior commitments) but hopefully you get a flavour of what I can do. It should be pretty pixel perfect looking at the Figma grid.

- TODO: Complete left nav, radios and tooltip
- More mobile friendly/flexible grid (would set up so can set col spans at diff breakpoints and retain grid)
- Addition of Storybook (or similar)
- Addition of visual regression (Applitools or similar)
- Addition of testing library (React testing library or similar)
- A11y goodness (ARIA, more semantic structure and similar)
- Would have created an Icon component so it would be easy to call in all the icons and their variants
- Pass custom select value and show children text separately in Field component (perhaps even seperate or extend)
- And so much more...

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:
